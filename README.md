# SAM Gutenberg Blocks

This plugin is a WIP that aims to create a series of blocks to use inside [SkillsAndMore](https://skillsandmore.org), but if someone want's to use its codebase for it's own project fell free to do so!

We'll be happy to see you contributing in this project as well and we're going to document our experience inside our blog and a specific course!

## List of blocks

## Block description
