## Alert Box

The alert box is a useful element for any article. This kind of block lets you indicate a message where your reader has to keep more attention. The Alert Box block comes with the following settings:
* box background color
* text color
* label background color
* label text color

For the moment i comes only with one style where we move the alert label to the left of the message but if you need more feel free to ask for them in the issue section.

## Call To Action
